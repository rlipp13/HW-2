<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr/>
<div class="main">
I am a fifth year senior in the Tippie College of Business. I will finally be graduating this May with a triple major in Accounting, MIS, and Finance. I will then proceed to continue studying as I attempt to take the CPA exam over the summer. Next Fall I will be moving to Minneapolis where I have accepted a job with Ernst and Young in the Risk Advisory practice. I will be traveling a majority of the time for my job, which I am excited for! Although I decided against moving somewhere warmer and bigger, I am more than excited to finally get out of Iowa.
<br/>
<hr />
I have lived in Iowa my entire life (originally from Cedar Rapids). While I was a freshman here at Iowa, my parents decided to move out to Denver, Colorado and leave me stuck here in Iowa. I am the second, and last, of two...so my parents wasted no time after I left home! My sister is now also living out in Denver, CO and just graduated from law school last year. She is married and has two of the cutest puppies you'll ever see!
<br/>
<hr/>
In the small of amount of spare time I have with my school schedule and the many other events I partake in, I decided to work at McGladrey part-time during this tax season. I prefer to stay busy, but this last semester of school will definitely be a challenge. I am a very easy-going person and love to be around other people. On the weekends you can catch me hanging out with friends, outside (if it's nice), at the rec center, or downtown at night.
